I am a Computer Science and Engineering graduate with hands-on experience in cybersecurity lab projects, including SOC home lab simulations, Splunk monitoring, Sysmon log analysis, and Active Directory security. With a strong foundation in threat detection, incident response, and SIEM rule tuning, I am eager to contribute to a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment.

## Objective

To join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, where I can apply my technical expertise in SIEM, EDR, and incident response to detect and mitigate cyber threats. My goal is to continuously grow into higher-tier SOC roles while contributing to a proactive security posture, gaining mentorship from experienced professionals, and leveraging my strong analytical and collaborative skills to protect organizational assets.
